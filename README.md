Also outputs details of any charitable donations made for all years:

```
     --Charitable Donations By Year--

2019: £    ???.?? / £???,???.??  =  0.42%
2020: £  ?,???.?? / £???,???.??  =  5.01%
2021: £  ?,???.?? / £???,???.??  =  4.56%
2022: £  ?,???.?? / £???,???.??  = 16.34%
2023: £  ?,???.?? / £???,???.??* =  6.84%
 *The current year's income is estimated
```
